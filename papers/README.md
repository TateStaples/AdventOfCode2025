# Advent of Code 2025 — Technical Papers (Algorithm + FPGA)

These reports are technical write-ups derived from the local puzzle descriptions in `questions/` and the reference implementations in `src/`.

> **Note:** Each paper explores multiple potential FPGA architectures as design options. Not all options were implemented in Hardcaml—see each paper's **Implementation Status** note for which designs were actually built. The implemented circuits are documented in [`hardcaml/README.md`](../hardcaml/README.md).
